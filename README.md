# PolyGlid

PolyGlid is a local-first, cross-platform desktop application for organizing
and managing local project workspaces. It is built in Rust with Dioxus and is
developed one working product phase at a time.

## Current Functionality

- Open the local PolyGlid workspace.
- Discover persisted projects.
- Create, select, and rename projects.
- Remove a project from the catalog.
- Permanently delete a project folder after explicit confirmation.
- Switch between configured local workspaces.

Future product areas are intentionally absent and will be introduced only when
their development phase begins.

## Development Setup

Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) with flakes enabled, then enter the
reproducible development environment:

```bash
nix develop
```

The shell provides Rust, Moon, the Dioxus CLI, Go, Git, and the native Linux
libraries required by Dioxus Desktop. It supports Linux x86-64/ARM64 and macOS
Apple Silicon. On macOS, Xcode Command Line Tools are also required.

Run the desktop application:

```bash
cargo run -p polyglid-desktop
```

Run workspace checks:

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Moon can orchestrate formatting, checks, tests, builds, and the website bundle:

```bash
moon run :format
moon run :check
moon run :test
moon run :build
moon run website:bundle
```

The full Rust verification used by CI is also available locally:

```bash
scripts/ci/verify-rust.sh
```

## Runtime Data

PolyGlid stores its local data in `~/.polyglid` on Unix-like systems and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%/PolyGlid` on Windows. Use these environment variables to
override the defaults when developing or testing:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POLYGLID_DATA_DIR` | Application data directory |
| `POLYGLID_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Default project workspace |

## CI and Releases

Every branch push and pull request to `main` runs formatting, checks, tests,
builds, and automation validation for affected projects. Pull request titles
use Conventional Commits to declare release intent:

| Pull request title | Version result |
| --- | --- |
| `feat!: change a public contract` | Major |
| `feat(desktop): add project search` | Minor |
| `fix(core): reject an unsafe path` | Patch |
| `docs: explain workspace setup` | No product release |

After changes land on `main`, Release Please prepares the release. Approved
releases are packaged for Linux, Windows, and macOS with checksums. Native
artifacts are currently unsigned pending release-key setup.

The website is built and deployed to GitHub Pages after successful `main` CI.
