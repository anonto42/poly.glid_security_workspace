# Project Scripts

Repository automation lives here instead of being embedded in workflow YAML.

- `ci/` contains validation, pinned tool setup, platform dependency setup, and
  workspace verification.
- `release/` contains release lockfile synchronization, platform packaging,
  package validation, AppImage metadata validation, and GitHub release
  publication. Every platform archive bundles the runtime-directory guidance
  used by first-run setup. The Windows release also produces a WiX v4 MSI with
  Start Menu registration and major-upgrade handling. The macOS release also
  produces an ARM64 `.app` bundle inside a `.dmg` with an Applications alias.
  Publishing generates `polyglid-update.json` beside `SHA256SUMS` for future
  automatic update clients.
- `site/` contains the reproducible Dioxus Web production build.

Run scripts from the repository root unless a script says otherwise.
